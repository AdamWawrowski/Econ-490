I had not realized that I was not using R Markdown to create the HTML file. 
I created the report by editing the HTML code instead.
As such, I do not have an R Markdown file. This is entirely my mistake.
I hope the R file with the code I used to answer the questions and the HTML is sufficient for PS 1 only.

Thank you,
